A FastAPIâ€‘based web service for processing Excel files and extracting structured table data based on predefined table titles.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This application processes Excel files (`.xls`/`.xlsx`) and extracts tables using a **titleâ€‘anchored boundary detection** algorithm. It solves common table extraction challenges like fragmentation, sparse data handling, and irregular layouts. The API supports file uploads, table listing, table details retrieval, and row calculations.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Intelligent Table Extraction**: Anchorâ€‘based detection with boundary calculation  
- **Multiâ€‘Engine Support**: Handles both `.xls` and `.xlsx` formats  
- **Fragmentation Prevention**: Horizontal segmentation & overlap tracking  
- **Advanced Data Cleaning**: Configurable thresholds for empty rows/columns  
- **Duplicate Handling**: Automatic disambiguation of duplicate table titles  
- **Row Calculations**: Numeric sum calculations with robust error handling  
- **API Documentation**: Autoâ€‘generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs  
- **File Validation**: Size limits, format validation, and content verification  

## ðŸ“Š Supported Table Titles

Exact titles the app will extract (caseâ€‘sensitive):

- `INITIAL INVESTMENT`
- `CASHFLOW DETAILS`
- `DISCOUNT RATE`
- `WORKING CAPITAL`
- `GROWTH RATES`
- `SALVAGE VALUE`
- `OPERATING CASHFLOWS`
- `BOOK VALUE & DEPRECIATION`
- `Investment Measures`

### Core Algorithm Explained

#### Title Location Scanning
- Scans every cell for exact title matches
- Records (row, col, title) for all occurrences

#### Vertical Boundary Calculation
- Tables extend down to the next title row (or end of sheet)
- Avoids splitting a single block across blank rows

#### Horizontal Segmentation
- If multiple titles share a row, splits the row into discrete segments
- Each segment belongs exclusively to its title

#### Overlap Prevention
- Marks every cell used by an extracted table
- Prevents adjacent tables from merging or doubleâ€‘counting

#### Adaptive Data Cleaning
- Drops rows/columns > 60% empty
- Trims leading/trailing blank runs longer than one row/column

## ðŸš§ Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenges Encountered

#### Breadthâ€‘First Search (BFS) Approach
- **Problem**: Irregular table shapes caused fragmentation
- **Issue**: Parts of the same visual table treated as separate tables
- **Solution**: Replaced with titleâ€‘based anchoring and explicit boundary logic

#### Direct Row/Column Empty Cell Detection
- **Problem**: Intentional spacing caused false splits
- **Issue**: Table headers separated from their data blocks
- **Solution**: Implemented configurable emptyâ€‘cell thresholds (e.g. drop rows/cols > 60% empty)

#### Excel Metadata and Grouping
- **Problem**: Inconsistent metadata across different source files
- **Issue**: Ungrouped or sparsely formatted tables were missed entirely
- **Solution**: Contentâ€‘based detection via exact title matches and boundary inference

#### Undefined Table Boundaries
- **Challenge**: Tables without clearly demarcated end rows or columns
- **Problem**: Data following blank lines could be omitted
- **Solution**: Gap analysis with streak counting to trim only intentional blank edges

#### Single File Pattern Recognition
- **Challenge**: Only one sample layout provided for development
- **Problem**: Unknown variability in other potential files
- **Solution**: Flexible boundary calculation that adapts to arbitrary title positions

### Solution Benefits
- **Reliability**: Consistent extraction regardless of table positioning
- **Flexibility**: Handles various table layouts, sideâ€‘byâ€‘side and vertical groupings
- **Robustness**: Graceful handling of malformed or sparse tables
- **Maintainability**: Easy to extend by adding new exact table titles

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Cases

#### Adjacent Tables Test
Verify that sideâ€‘byâ€‘side tables on the same row do not merge into one block.

#### Sparse Table Test
Confirm that tables with up to 60% empty rows/columns are still preserved as single tables.

#### Duplicate Title Test
Check that multiple occurrences of the same title (e.g. two "DISCOUNT RATE" blocks) get disambiguated (DISCOUNT RATE (1), DISCOUNT RATE (2)).

#### Edge Table Test
Validate that a table at the bottom of the sheet (no following title) extracts fully down to the last row.

#### Emptyâ€‘Sheet Test
Upload an entirely blank Excel sheet â†’ expect a clear error "No tables found" (HTTP 400).

#### Nonâ€‘Numericâ€‘Rows Test
Request /row_sum on a row with no numeric cells â†’ should return sum: 0.0, not an error.

#### Malformedâ€‘Title Test
Provide a sheet where a title is misspelled â†’ ensure that block is not extracted (exact matching).

#### Mergedâ€‘Cell Test
Use merged header/data cells â†’ verify they appear as single string entries, not split or dropped.

- **Enhanced Calculations**: Support percent formatting, currency conversion, and custom aggregations.
- **Batch Processing**: Allow uploading and processing multiple files in one request.
- **UI Dashboard**: Build a simple React/Vue frontend to upload files and display tables visually.
- **Export Features**: CSV/JSON/Excel exports of individual tables.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Let users register new tableâ€‘title patterns via configuration files.


## Missed Edge Cases & Examples

- **Entirely Blank Workbook**  
  *Scenario*: You upload a `.xlsx` with no filled cells.  
  *Expected Behavior*: API returns HTTP 400 "No tables found in the uploaded Excel file."

- **Tables with Zero Numeric Cells**  
  *Scenario*: A "COST BREAKDOWN" table where every cell is text ("High", "Medium", "Low").  
  *Expected Behavior*: Calling `/row_sum?table_name=COST BREAKDOWN&row_name=High` returns `{ "sum": 0.0 }` rather than an error.

- **Malformed or Partially Matching Titles**  
  *Scenario*: The sheet contains "INIITAL INVESTMENT" (typo) instead of "INITIAL INVESTMENT".  
  *Expected Behavior*: No table is extracted for that header, and `/list_tables` simply omits it; requests for that name return 404.

- **Merged Cells Spanning Multiple Columns**  
  *Scenario*: "OPERATING CASHFLOWS" header is a merged cell across A1:C1, with data beneath.  
  *Expected Behavior*: The extractor treats the merged region as one column labeled "OPERATING CASHFLOWS", not three separate empty columns.

- **Hidden Rows/Columns**  
  *Scenario*: Row 3 (a header) or Column D (data) is hidden in Excel.  
  *Expected Behavior*: Decide whether hidden rows should be ignored or included; currently they're treated like any other cell, which may be surprising.

- **Localeâ€‘Specific Number Formats**  
  *Scenario*: German locale entries like "1 234,56" (space thousands, comma decimal).  
  *Expected Behavior*: Our `float()` conversions fail; we'd need to preâ€‘process or specify locale to parse correctly.

- **Cells Containing Formulas**  
  *Scenario*: A cell holds `=SUM(B2:B5)` instead of the computed result.  
  *Expected Behavior*: Pandas reads the literal formula text; sums should instead use the evaluated numeric result.

- **Multiple Sheets with Identical Titles**  
  *Scenario*: Both Sheet1 and Sheet2 include a table called "INITIAL INVESTMENT."  
  *Expected Behavior*: Without sheetâ€‘scoping, one will overwrite the other; optionally prefix table names with sheet names.

- **Highly Irregular Layouts**  
  *Scenario*: A table where 50% of rows and 50% of columns are blank (visual spacing).  
  *Expected Behavior*: With our 60% threshold it survives; if the threshold changes it could be dropped unintentionally.
